A tuple is container which holds a series of comma separated values (items or elements) between parentheses such as an (x, y) co-ordinate.
Tuples are like lists, except they are immutable (i.e. you cannot change its content once created) and can hold mix data types.

val = input('Enter some numbers separated by coma\n')
list = val.split(',')
tupleList = tuple(list)
print('Tuple : ', tupleList)
print('List : ', list)

#output
Enter some numbers separated by coma
5,6,7,8
Tuple :  ('5', '6', '7', '8')
List :  ['5', '6', '7', '8']
